## words-generator
A simple program to compute words generated from a specific Apery set

### TODO:
[ ] For 4 generators, determine the minimum number of words to exclude so that each word's occurrences match its corresponding numerical value's occurrences.
[ ] Add error handling.
[ ] Some methods in WordGenerator need to be more generic to work with different word lists.
